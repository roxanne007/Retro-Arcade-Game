# 🎮 Arcade Game

A retro-style browser-based arcade game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, game logic, and interactive UI design. It was a fun way to explore how real-time browser-based games are structured, and how to manage player input, score tracking, and game state in a responsive way.
